Hi there, I'm Yufeng Xu, a CS student at NYU Shanghai 26'. I'm also a CV and NLP Researcher at NYU. 

In my spare time, I like playing soccer, watching movies, and listening to all kinds of music.
- I'm a Manchester City fan, and I play soccer every week with my friends! My favorite postions are CM and CDM.
- I watch old movies every once in a while. Some of the directors that I really admire include Woody Allen, Ang Lee, and Denis Villeneuve.
- Some albums I really enjoyed include the following. Maybe we share some common favorites!
