title: Week 6 - My Open Source Contributions
---

As I learned more about Open Source by taking this course, I've made some contributions to existing open source projects. Here are the details of my contributions and my thoughts! &darr;

## OpenStreetMap
The first open source contribution I made was for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84), a free and open online map. I noticed a new bubble tea store near the NYU Lafayette dorm opened recently, which had not been updated on OpenStreetMap. Instead, the position of the bubble tea store was a Pharmacy according to OpenStreetMap. Therefore, I submitted [a request](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/161963345) to fix this.

## Github
In addition, I made 5 contributions to github repos relevant to this course, including issues, responses, and pull requests. Most of the contributions I made were related to minor problems, such as typos, broken links, missing pages, etc. The details can be found [here](https://ossd-s25.github.io/Zephyr271828-weekly/contributions/).
I've decided to focus on contributions to projects on github (instead Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap) because I believe Github is the place that I will make many significant contributions in the future, and I want to get involved in this community as much as possible from now on. Although the contributions I've made are minor ones, I've been looking at some tutorial projects (such as [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp), [OI Wiki](https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki), [pytorch-cn](https://github.com/awfssv/pytorch-cn), [opencsapp](https://github.com/opencsapp/opencsapp.github.io)) whose source code can be found on github. Because these projects most consist of documents, I believe I can make contributions as long as I know some of the information. 
Besides, I've been learning about contributing to the [Huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface) open source projects, which is also my target project for the final course project. I believe I will be able to engage in the discussion forums and submit code fixes to some easy issues.
